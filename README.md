# A Brief Tutorial on Machine Learning with NLTK/Python

This is a tutorial on machine learning techniques using NLTK in Python. It is based on Python 2.7 and NLTK3.

You can see the example code in [NLTK.ipynb](https://github.com/brandeis-cosi140b-s16/nltk_tutorial/blob/master/NLTK.ipynb)

To run the code locally, you need to have [ipython](https://ipython.org/) and [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook. 
Once you have tools installed, clone this repository. 
To open up the tutorial notebook, run jupyter from command line.
